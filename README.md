# NextJS Starter kit

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Available Scripts

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using NextJS.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run format`

Checks the code formatting using `Prettier`.\
This mode is recommended in CI as a sanity check, as the user has to manually
make changes to pass the check.

#### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner using `Vitest` in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run test:watch`

Runs the test runner in watch mode without coverage.

#### `npm run test:ui`

Runs the test runner in the UI mode using `Vitest`.
